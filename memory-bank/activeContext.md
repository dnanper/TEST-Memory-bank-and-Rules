# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial planning and design phase. The core class structure has been defined with a UML-style overview, but implementation has not yet begun. The focus is on finalizing the design before proceeding with code implementation.

## Recent Changes

1. Created a memory bank to document project requirements and design
2. Established the class hierarchy and relationships between components
3. Documented the technical approach and constraints

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `Vehicle` base class with all required attributes and methods
2. Implement the derived `Car` and `Motorbike` classes
3. Implement the `Customer` and `GarageOwner` classes
4. Create the main program flow and user interface
5. Implement sorting functionality for vehicle listings
6. Test all components and their interactions
7. Document the finalized implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Memory Management Strategy**: Deciding on the most appropriate approach for managing dynamic collections of vehicles
2. **User Interface Design**: Planning the command-line interface for user interactions
3. **Error Handling**: Determining how to handle invalid inputs and exceptional conditions
4. **Test Cases**: Identifying key test cases to validate functionality

## Current Questions

1. Should we implement a more modern approach to memory management (like smart pointers)?
2. How will we handle potential memory leaks in the transfer of vehicles between owners?
3. Is the current class structure sufficient to meet all requirements?
4. Should we add additional functionality beyond the basic requirements?
