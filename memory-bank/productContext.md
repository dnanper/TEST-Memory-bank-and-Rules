# Product Context

## Problem Statement

The Vehicle Market System addresses the need for an educational simulation of a vehicle marketplace, helping demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in a practical context. It provides a framework for understanding inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management while modeling real-world business relationships.

## Solutions Provided

1. **Object Hierarchy**: Creates a clear representation of vehicle types through inheritance
2. **Business Relationships**: Models the relationships between garage owners (sellers) and customers (buyers)
3. **Inventory Management**: Provides mechanisms for adding, displaying, and sorting vehicle inventories
4. **Purchase Simulation**: Allows the transfer of vehicles from sellers to buyers

## User Experience Goals

1. **Command-Line Interface**: Simple text-based interaction for all operations
2. **Clear Display**: Structured output of vehicle information
3. **Intuitive Operations**: Logical operations for vehicle management and transactions
4. **Educational Value**: Code structure that clearly demonstrates OOP principles

## Target Users

1. **Students**: Learning object-oriented programming concepts
2. **Educators**: Demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management
3. **Developers**: Practicing C++ implementation of OOP principles
