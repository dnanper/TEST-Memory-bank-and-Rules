# Vehicle Market System - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Vehicle Market System is an object-oriented C++ application that simulates a marketplace for vehicles. It employs inheritance hierarchies, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management to create a system where garage owners can list and sell vehicles to customers.

## Core Requirements

1. Implement a class hierarchy with a base `Vehicle` class and derived classes for specific vehicle types
2. Demonstrate polymorphism using virtual functions
3. Implement proper memory management with constructors, destructors, and dynamic arrays
4. Create functionality for garage owners to manage inventory
5. Create functionality for customers to purchase vehicles
6. Implement sorting capabilities for vehicle listings by different criteria

## Technical Goals

1. Follow object-oriented programming principles
2. Implement clean, well-documented code
3. Ensure memory safety through proper memory management
4. Create an intuitive class structure that models real-world relationships

## Project Scope

This project focuses on building a command-line application that simulates the relationships between vehicle types, garage owners, and customers. The project is primarily educational, demonstrating OOP concepts in C++.
