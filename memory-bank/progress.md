# Progress

## What Works

1. Project planning and design documentation complete
2. Class diagram with relationships defined

## What's Left to Build

1. **Base Classes**:

   - [ ] `Vehicle` base class implementation
   - [ ] `Car` derived class implementation
   - [ ] `Motorbike` derived class implementation

2. **Actor Classes**:

   - [ ] `Customer` class implementation
   - [ ] `GarageOwner` class implementation

3. **Functionality**:

   - [ ] Vehicle management for garage owners
   - [ ] Purchase functionality for customers
   - [ ] Vehicle sorting capabilities
   - [ ] Display methods for all vehicle types

4. **Program Flow**:

   - [ ] Main program structure
   - [ ] User interface implementation
   - [ ] Input validation

5. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Test cases for all major functionality
   - [ ] Memory leak checking

## Current Status

The project is in the initial design phase. The class structure and relationships have been defined, but no actual code has been implemented yet. The next step is to begin implementing the base `Vehicle` class and its derived classes.

## Known Issues

1. **Memory Management**: Need to ensure proper handling of vehicle transfers between actors
2. **UI Design**: Command-line interface design needs to be finalized
3. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach needed
