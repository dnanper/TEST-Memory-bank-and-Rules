# Notion Documentation Tracking

## Context

- Used when explicitly requested to track documentation in Notion
- Applies after PLAN mode execution to maintain documentation
- Helps maintain a centralized record of project planning and documentation in Notion

## Critical Rules

- When user requests Notion documentation tracking, use MCP Notion Tool to retrieve the page ID of "0. Inbox" page
- After executing PLAN mode, create a new page under "0. Inbox" with appropriate title
- Update the new page content with comprehensive documentation generated during planning
- Include project context, strategies, and next steps in the documentation
- Maintain consistent formatting for all Notion documentation entries
- Notify user when documentation has been successfully saved to Notion

## Examples

<example>
User: Let's plan the authentication system implementation.
Assistant: I'll help you plan the authentication system implementation. First, let me review the Memory Bank to understand the current state of the project.

[Agent reads Memory Bank files]

Based on the project requirements, here's my proposed authentication system implementation plan:
[Detailed plan follows...]

Now I'll document this plan in Notion:
1. Retrieved page ID for "0. Inbox"
2. Created new page titled "Authentication System Implementation Plan"
3. Updated page with complete documentation including context, strategy, and next steps
4. Notion documentation successfully saved

User: Great, let's implement this plan.
</example>
